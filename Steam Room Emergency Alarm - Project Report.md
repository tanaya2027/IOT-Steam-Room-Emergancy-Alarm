# Steam Room Emergency Alarm System - Project Report

## Abstract
This project implements an IoT-based monitoring and alarm system for steam rooms, designed to enhance safety by detecting dangerous temperature levels. The system continuously monitors temperature and humidity using a DHT11 sensor connected to a NodeMCU ESP8266. When temperatures exceed a predefined threshold (35.5째C), the system activates an emergency buzzer with a 1-second on/off pattern and sends alerts to a web dashboard. The dashboard provides real-time visualization of environmental conditions, historical data analysis, and alert management. The system connects to AWS IoT Core for secure cloud communication, ensuring reliable monitoring even when the local server is unavailable.

### Connection Description
The NodeMCU ESP8266 serves as the main controller, connecting to both the DHT11 sensor and the buzzer. The DHT11 sensor provides temperature and humidity readings, which are processed by the NodeMCU. When the temperature exceeds the preset threshold, the NodeMCU activates the buzzer by sending HIGH signals to pin D2 in a 1-second on/off pattern. The NodeMCU connects to the local WiFi network to communicate with the server and AWS IoT Core.

## Features of the Project

### Temperature and Humidity Monitoring
The system uses a DHT11 sensor to measure temperature and humidity levels in the steam room. Readings are taken continuously and sent to both the local server and AWS IoT Core at regular intervals. The data is displayed on the web dashboard in real-time and stored for historical analysis.

### Emergency Alert System
When the temperature exceeds the preset threshold of 35.5째C, the system enters an emergency state. The buzzer is activated in a 1-second on/off pattern to create an audible alert. Simultaneously, an emergency alert is sent to the web dashboard, triggering a visual notification for remote users.

### Web Dashboard
The web dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring the steam room conditions. It includes:
- Real-time temperature and humidity displays
- Historical charts with adjustable time ranges (1h, 6h, 24h)
- Alert management system
- System status indicators
- Analytics for usage patterns

### Alert Management
The system maintains a record of all alerts, categorized by type (temperature, humidity, system). Users can view active alerts and mark them as resolved. When an alert is resolved, the system sends a command to turn off the buzzer if it's active.

### Cloud Integration
AWS IoT Core integration provides a secure and reliable connection between the device and the cloud. This enables:
- Remote monitoring from anywhere with internet access
- Backup data storage in case the local server is unavailable
- Secure communication using TLS/SSL encryption
- Remote control capabilities

## Results

The Steam Room Emergency Alarm System has been successfully implemented and tested. The system accurately monitors temperature and humidity conditions in the steam room environment. When the temperature exceeds the threshold of 35.5째C, the buzzer alarm activates with a 1-second on/off pattern, providing clear audible alerts to those in the vicinity.

The web dashboard displays real-time data and historical trends, allowing for comprehensive monitoring of steam room conditions. Alerts are properly categorized and can be managed through the user interface. The "Resolved" button effectively silences the buzzer when alerts are acknowledged.

AWS IoT Core integration provides reliable cloud connectivity, ensuring that the system can be monitored remotely even when the local server may be unavailable. The system has demonstrated high reliability during testing, with successful detection of elevated temperatures and proper alert notification.

The buzzer's 1-second on/off pattern provides a distinct and attention-grabbing alert that is easily noticed in noisy environments. The system's response time from detection to alarm activation is under 1 second, ensuring timely alerts in emergency situations.

## Conclusion

The Steam Room Emergency Alarm System successfully fulfills its aim of providing a reliable monitoring and alert system for steam room environments. By combining local hardware alerts (buzzer) with remote monitoring capabilities (web dashboard), the system ensures that dangerous temperature conditions are promptly detected and addressed.

The integration with AWS IoT Core adds an extra layer of reliability and enables remote access, making this system suitable for commercial steam rooms where constant monitoring is essential for customer safety. The historical data collection and analysis features provide valuable insights into steam room usage patterns and potential safety issues.

Future enhancements could include:
1. Adding more sensors to monitor additional parameters like steam pressure
2. Implementing automatic shutdown mechanisms for the steam generator when temperatures exceed safe levels
3. Developing a mobile app for even more convenient remote monitoring
4. Integrating with building management systems for centralized monitoring
5. Adding machine learning capabilities to predict potential issues before they occur

Overall, this project demonstrates the effective application of IoT technologies to enhance safety in everyday environments, providing both immediate alerts and long-term monitoring capabilities.
